# PythonChat

A clientâ€“server chat system built over a custom application-layer protocol atop **UDP**. This project explores building messaging functionality, reliability features, and protocol design over an unreliable transport layer.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

PythonChat provides a basic chat application layer where:

- Clients can **register**, **log in**, and **exchange messages** (global broadcast or direct messages).
- The protocol is built on **UDP** (no inherent connection or guaranteed delivery).
- Reliability is added at the application layer (acknowledgments, retransmissions).
- Integrity checks via hashing ensure message data isnâ€™t tampered with.
- Offline message storage is supported, so users receive missed messages when reconnecting.

## ðŸ§© Features

- **Account Management** â€” Register new users and authenticate existing ones  
- **Broadcast & Private Messaging** â€” Send messages to all users or specific recipients  
- **Reliability Layer** â€” ACKs, retransmissions, timeouts  
- **Integrity Verification** â€” Hashing (e.g., SHA) on message content  
- **Offline Storage** â€” Server holds messages for offline users and delivers them later  
- **Protocol Debugging** â€” Use of **Wireshark** or packet captures to inspect message exchange

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Tools

- **Language:** Python  
- **Networking:** UDP sockets  
- **Hashing & Integrity:** SHA-based hashing  
- **Tools:** Wireshark / packet capture analysis for protocol verification

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `client.py` â€” client-side logic for sending/receiving messages  
- `server.py` â€” central server handling authentication, routing, and storage  
- (Optionally) modules or utilities for hashing, retry logic, message encoding
